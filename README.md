Hi! I'm Esma Hećimović-Huseinbašić. I have Bachelor and Master's Degree from Architecture. I have worked on many projects regarding architectural design, urban design, urban planning, Building Information Modeling, interior design, etc. During my education, I was also
interested in Graphic Design, and recently I've decided to switch to UI/UX design. Here are some of my projects: 

 <br>
 <br>

This is my design for a travel planner app called *'Tranner'*. Softwares I used for creating this are Adobe Photoshop and InVision.  Checkout [live example of my InVision work (on invisionapp.com)](https://esmaheimovihuseinbai762888.invisionapp.com/overview/Trannel-ck5k66a3t0xbd01c06e0x8l29/screens?v=YsWUxV1ZUe8gma5fe9gQVA%3D%3D&linkshare=urlcopied). This is how it looks:
